# Project: Brains 4 Buildings Human Well-being using HRV

**The Dutch government aims for a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 (compared to 1990).** Even in the most modern buildings, 10-30 % of the energy is lost due to faulty installations or incorrect use of the systems. In addition, the indoor climate is often substandard and the operational costs are high. By giving buildings a ‘brain’, data from smart meters, climate control systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to make better decisions. Techniques are very promising, but current models and algorithms are not yet fast and efficient enough to actually make buildings smarter, and implementation is difficult.
**To help in this endeavor the brains for buildings (B4B) program was started. B4B aims at leveraging AI and machine learning (ML) models to reduce energy consumption, increase comfort, respond flexibly to user wellbeing and save on installation maintenance costs. ML makes use of the data generated from smart meters, building management systems and IoT devices.**
