# Project: Prediction of human wellbeing for building optimization - part of project Brains4Building (2020 - 2021)
Within the B4B project we would like to execute an applied research project in the field of how AI can be applied to get more information about the user satisfaction, comfort and interaction within building. This information should lead to building improvements of the building automation, but also a way to inform the users how to use the building to get more comfort. An example is that the building automation could create a specific comfort condition in one part of the building and a different one in another part of the building. 

## Consortium collaboration
During a  separate consortium meeting at 16 September 2021 we have zoomed into the possible applied research questions we would like to do within this student project. This document is the outcome of this meeting and will be the starting point for the students to start with the project. All participant are willing to create an ”expert” project board that can be used by the students to get data sets, steering and information that is important for a successful project. Eventually the students will articulate themselves the final applied research question(s) and goal(s) to execute the project and create the necessary results for the project.

Four ideas have been discussed during the meeting:
1.	Human interface to measure subjective comfort and experience of how people feel, how to people respond to and how to get information from people. The goal is to get a grip on how people feel and how this can be used to further optimize the building automation system. It would be nice to create a permanent feedback loop. Feedback of the people can be active or passive. Examples of active feedback could be done by using app’s and push buttons. Passive feedback is for example using camera’s to see if people are happy or by means of temperature and humidity. This is a continuous game finding the balance between users/buildings.
2.	Mapping objective and passive measurements. Using machine learning to see if there is a correlation between objective measurements and how people feel. Different objective sources can be used.
3.	To determine the objective criteria, besides temperature and relative humidity, that correlates with the wellbeing or satisfaction of people. For example noise, smell, light and CO2 could be used.
4.	A lot of data is available within buildings and can be used to measure the movement of people of instance. An example is the elevator movement that can be used. It would be nice to see what data is really needed. The goal is not having an optimal set, but more to see what could be used that is already available within buildings.

## Background
There are existing models the model how people feel. Unfortunately, these models have a mismatch what people actually feel. How could we measure the comfort of people. Furthermore, getting feedback from people is difficult. Usually the people that are not satisfied  use these feedback tools. Transforming these feedback tools into complaint tools. Therefore, the feedback is not matched with the real situation.  How to get correct and good feedback from people is therefore a good research topic. Furthermore, people are willing to cooperate to give feedback for example two weeks. However, when the feedback period takes much longer, the people get less willingness.

Another aspect that is seen is that people are happy while the building comfort is not good. In this case, other elements like working at a good company, count largely for the wellbeing of the people. Finding the balance for the whole or individual is a challenging task. It is needed to find a balance that suits everybody. At the other hand, it is also possible to meet individual people in different areas of the building.

It can be concluded that comfort is not only measuring temperature and humidity. Al lot can play a role in the wellbeing of the people. Influencing people to get more comfort is also possible. So, it could also be about the interaction between the building and the people.

## Possible project approach
At the end of the meeting we have tried to get a first idea of the project assignment in terms of an applied research question. The students are able to define the final applied research question(s) for their project. However, we would like to provide a good starting point. The following has been discussed:
1.	What kind of data should we collect to be able to measure the comfort and wellbeing of the people?
2.	How could we collect this data actively and passively to measure the comfort and wellbeing of the people?
3.	What are the objective criteria we should match against?
4.	Can we use machine learning to find patterns between the objective measurements and subjective comfort/wellbeing of the people?

The goal is to find which machine learning algorithm is the most suitable by benchmarking how well the different solutions perform. Experiments can be conducted in the living labs. In order to get data, these experiments needs to be performed as soon as possible.
