	\section{Introduction}
	One of the deliverables within this project is a prototype for an app where users have a UX friendly way to predict the human satisfaction of a classroom or office. 
	
	\section{What should the prototype be}
	The prototype will consist of two parts an UX friendly frontend, and a back end  that uses a machine learning model to predict the human satisfaction in a room. The frontend app will make use off the principles learned during HCAID to make sure the person using the app trusts the app and understands why the prediction came to this result. 
	
	
	\section{how will the prototype be delivered}
	The prototype will be delivered as a hosted service and a zip file with source code.
	
	\section{when do we consider the prototype to be "done"}
	The prototype is considered done when the following conditions are met:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The prototype makes use of a machine learning model to make predictions
		\item the prototype should have an API endpoint for other applications to use.
		\item the frontend of the prototype should make use of either LIME or SHAP to explain the decision the model came to. 
		\item the frontend app should make use of the the seven heuristics of AI as explained \href{https://brightspace.avans.nl/d2l/le/lessons/36627/topics/304705}{here}
		
	\end{enumerate}
