\section{Introduction}
One of the deliverables within this project is a MLOps pipeline used for the periodic extracting and processing of climate data, and the training, validating and uploading of a machine learning model. This document describes what steps the MLOps pipeline should contain and when it is considered done.

\section{What should the MLOps pipeline do?}
The MLOps pipeline should be able to periodically collect new data from a variety of sources. This data should then be processed. After processing a machine learning model must be trained. To ensure the trustworthiness of the model an accuracy test must be passed before it's deployed to our application.

\section{When do we consider the MLOps pipeline to be "done"?}
The MLOps pipeline is considered done when the following pipeline steps are implemented:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Obtain the dataset
	\item Clean the dataset
	\item Process the dataset
	\item Train model
	\item Validate that the model accuracy is above a certain threshold.
	\item Upload trained model to prototype
\end{enumerate}
