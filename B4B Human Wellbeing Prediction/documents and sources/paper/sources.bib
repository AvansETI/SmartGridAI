	abstract = {Predicting building occupants’ thermal comfort via machine learning (ML) is a hot research topic. Many algorithms and data processing methods have been applied to predict thermal comfort indices in different contexts. But few studies have systematically investigated how different algorithms and data processing methods can influence the prediction accuracy. In this study, we first summarized the recent literature from perspectives of predicted comfort indices, algorithms applied, input features, data sources, sample size, training proportion, predicting accuracy, etc. Then, we applied nine ML algorithms and three data sampling methods to predict the 3-point and 7-point thermal sensation vote (TSV) in ASHRAE Comfort Database II. The results show that with an accuracy of 66.3\% and 61.1\% for 3-point and 7-point TSV respectively, Random Forest (RF) has the best performance among the tested algorithms. Compared to the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model, ML TSV models generally have higher accuracy in TSV prediction. Based on feature importance analysis, the air temperature, humidity, clothing, air velocity, age, and metabolic rate are the top six important features for TSV prediction. The RF algorithm can achieve 63.6\% overall accuracy in TSV prediction with the top three features, which is only 2.6\% lower than involving 12 input features. Further, this paper addressed other common considerations in ML comfort model establishment such as tuning hyperparameters, splitting of training and testing data, and encoding methods. We also provided Python and R programming codes and packages as appendixes, which can be a good reference for future studies.}

	abstract = {Thermal comfort evaluations in the built environment are essential to occupant's satisfaction and also building energy consumption. Traditionally, thermal comfort has been assessed by Fanger's PMV model that was developed based on extensive laboratory tests. However, it's been found that PMV predictions are not good in field studies, especially in buildings with natural ventilation. In this paper, machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to predicted occupants’ thermal comfort votes (TCV) and thermal sensation votes (TSV), using 5512 sets of thermal comfort data collected in naturally ventilated residential buildings in fourteen cities in China. Environmental parameters, personal parameters, climatic types, and adaptive control measures were considered and used as input parameters for the ML model. It was found that environmental parameters (both outdoors and indoors), personal parameters (metabolic rate and clothing insulation), and climatic types all significant affect both TCV and TSV, while adaptive control measures only affect TSV but not TCV. Comparing with established models (PMV, ePMV and aPMV), the ML models had smaller errors in predicting TSV and TCV. Based on these results, we suggest that the ML, especially ANNs model was reliable in predicting occupants’ TCV and TSV in naturally ventilated residential buildings, and performed better than traditional thermal balance based models. Moreover, using the new model, we found that acceptable temperature ranges in naturally ventilated buildings were far wider than the ASHRAE adaptive comfort zone, suggesting that appropriate models should be established based on local data.}
