# SmartGridAI

The SmartGridAI project is to apply known machine learning algorithms on the problem of controlling the smart grid or the micro grid at our house. Support by two research teams of Avans University of Applied Sciences, namely Smart Energy and Datascience & ICT. Within the Minor Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies 2019-2020, students have experimented with reinforcement learning. The project results is a development environment and a openAI Gym environment to play around with a smart grid
