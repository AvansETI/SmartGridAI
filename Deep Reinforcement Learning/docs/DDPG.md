## Implementing an DDPG algorithm in the Smartgrid environment

### Why this choice
`(Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients) DDPG Extended for parameterized action space` our environment contains a `discrete-continous hybrid action space` this means that the action space contains both discrete and continous actions. Because of this there's no conventional solution that supports both, we try to remedy this by using DDPG Extended.

### What is DDPG
DDPG is a Policy Gradient Algorithm that uses a stochastic behavior policy
for good exploration but estimates a deterministic target policy, which is much easier to learn.
