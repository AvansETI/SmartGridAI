# SmartGridAI
SmartGrid AI is a research area that applies artificial intelligence within the context of the energy transition.

# Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
 Students have been working on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Such algorithm is able to control a smart grid, like batteries and dishwashers for example. It has been shown that DRL could be used to control a smart grid at home. However, the DRL algorithm showed learning, but it was still not performing quite well.

Improvement of these algorithm, could be found in the prediction of the datasource that are used by these algorithms. This project is about how artificial intelligence can be applied to predict time serie signals. Time serie data sources that need to be predicted are solar panels and consumption of energy.

# Time serie preduiction
The goal of this project is to get a time serie database that accepts (real-)time serie data sources. Within a dashboard the time serie signals together with the prediction of these data sources in time. Furthermore, the dashboard should show how well the prediction performs to predict the data source. It should be possible to add new data sources and add prediction to these data sources.

# Background
The research group Expertise centre of Technical Innovation, Within Avans University of Applied Science, performs research in the field of the energy transition. SmartGrid AI applies machine learning to improve the energy management of a smart grid. With the goal to become fully energy neutral. Within Avans University of Applied Sciences the goal is to become energy neutral. This year all results will be applied to improve the energy management of the laboraty SENDLAB. One room that we would like to make energy neutral.

# Problem statement
Due to the complexity of a smart grid (in a building, campus or room), becoming energy neutral is a difficult (control) task. A lot of uncertainty and system limiations needs to be taken into account. Another aspect is the variety and multiple components that produces and consumes energy. Last project, students have applied deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The algoritm showed that it was able to learn and improve during time. Unfortunately, it has not yet leaded to significant improvement of the energy management of the smart grid.

The algorithm could be improved when the algorithm also get a prediction of the production and consumption of the energy flows within the smart grid. Preduction of time serie data is not yet researched within SmartGrid AI.
