# Smart Building System Dataset

The dataset used in our AISTATS'17 work contains the data for 5 different types of measurements from 50 rooms in an office building.

Each room includes 5 types of measurements: CO2 concentration, room air humidity, room temperature, luminosity, and PIR motion sensor data.

Each file contains the time stamps (in Unix Epoch Time) and actual readings from the sensor.
